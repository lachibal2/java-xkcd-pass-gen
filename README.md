XKCD password generator rework in Java

Made by: Lachi Balabanski

## Information
This password generator gets more and more safe as you increase the number of words you wish to use.
This password generator was inspired by xkcd, https://xkcd.com/936/
I added in a special character in the words for extra security.
Feel free to add more uncommon words to uncommonwords.txt for a greater variety in passwords.

**This is a rework in Java from the previous xkcd password generator in Python 3. Both work in the exact same way.**
